Englishmau in the service oi Roger II oi Sicily, and is described
in various charters oi that king irom ¹¹37 onwards as ‘magister
Thomas capellanus' or ‘familiaris Regis,’ and in a Greek charter

william the Wicked in 1154. He may possibly have arrived in
England in 1158, as Ralph his nephew received 4d. a day out of
the iarm oi Hereiordshire sor that year and the next. li so, he is
probably the ‘Thomas clericus' who received a palirey out oi the
imm ot' London in 1158. In 1160 he received 5d. a day froin the
ratmot Hereiord, and was still receiving it in 1175. Besides this,
