182 DE SCACCARIO

Underlining as described in the text, perhaps the¹ most usual form
of deleting words. (4) Expunging or placing a dot under each

letter to be left out. (5) Obliteration (cf. 11. ii. Β, below), or ¹

blotting out, i. e. couering the whole word or passage with inlr as

a prees censor ‘ bishs’ an objectionable passage in a newspaper. ι

Ρ. 81, l. ¹9· in serie: along the line, not above it ae usual.
This rule is not strictly observed‚ as will be seen on reference to

the printed Pipe Rolls (cf. P. R. ar Hen. 11, p. rao n, p. 161 u, ἶ

p. 184 ιι. Ν.Β. The so·called C. R. of this year is really the P. R.).

It was subsequently renewcd in ιο Edward 11, almost in the words =

of the Dialogus (Red Bcolr, ed. Hall, iii p. 858).

l. ιι. scriptis petendum. Here, apparently, as in 11. ii. ,
B, C, below, simply a public document. Letters patent, as after· ¹
ι warde technicclly distinguished from charters or letters close, were ,
not differentiated as early as the reign of Henry 11. For ‘Littere ι

Patentes’ in another sense, cf. 11. xxvii. C, below.

‘Epitaphium Senecae'2-

‘Cura labor, meritum, sumpti pro munere honores,

P. aa, ι. ι. enus men. rue ‘scriptor cancelariae' ont,
writes the wrfts ordered to issue by the barone at the Erchequer, .
viz. those of ‘liberate ' or payment, of ‘computate’ or allowance,

'and of ‘perdono' or pardon; the awkward use of ‘ nichilominus’

suggests that the words ‘nichilominus . . .decreuerint' are an after-

thought.

l.'18.E. rex, etc. The writs printed by Madox (Hr'st.
Exch, x, 5 13. note q, p. 268) and Round(Anc. Charlers, No. 585 ;

Ρ. R. Soc. vol. ιο. p. 96), though ιιο doubt similar to Exchequer

writs of the period, are neither of them attested at the Exchequer‚ ’
and must accordingly have been issued from the ‘Curia Regis' ι

Both are writs of Lt'berate.
l. 23. oportet etiam The senae of this passage is as

follows All writs either of leberale, or perdono, or of computate

made at the Exchequer are made in duplicate. The originale
