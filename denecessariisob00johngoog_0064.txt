found nothing to distrain upon ⁸. He ia then free to go.

The greater part of the debts collected hythe Excbequer are
levicd through the aheriff3 but there are already other accountants,

Roll of Danegeld, iu the Red Boolr ol the Exchequer⁸ there ia

ol Danegeld set out upon the roll, Just aa there was no sum ol the
coanty in any roll os Henry II or ol King Richard up to the eighth
year oi his reign3 and that lor thia reason, aa 1 heard from william
of Ely, the Treaeurer, uamely, th'at the sheriffa might be kept in
ifflomnce of the aum lor which they had to account But, aster
the writing ol the sherih'a account and adding up the suma ex·
pended hom the body of the oounty, the Treasurer brought out
theron containing the ruma of the several countiea and placed the
partiouar euru above, and then subtracted the expenaea, and ao

eadhed the aherill or placed him iu debt or allowed him a enrplua.
Thia aleo was done for Denegeld; but that roll I never saw, though
the other 1 have seen!
