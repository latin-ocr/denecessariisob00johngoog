needed, or more. In either csse a pound by tale (ie. rgo pence)
was pliced in s cup to be sssayed, while the remaining twenty-four
chillings were returned to the purse. The melter received his lee
olrd, snd two sherilis were appointed to accompany the sheriff
whose money was under examination and act ss witnesses. The
pesom and the three sheriffs then went to the furnace, where the
melter awsited them. The coins were recounted‚ first hy the
pesonr and then hythe melter, who proceeded to assay them. As
the description oi the process is conlusing, a lull translationis here
‘The melter tslres the coins in his own hand, counts them and
cruenges thern in acupel, or test oi wood ashes (vmculm r’gnr'tomm
αὶιιηηι), which is in the furnace. He then reduces them to an
ingot (amram) according to the rules of the melter's art, melting

and pariiying the silwer. But he mustbe carelul not to stop before ’

the process is complete, nor to vex and consume the silver by
antecessa'ry heat; since, in the tormer csse the iring, in the lstter
the sheriff, would lose. He must tale everycare snd exercise all
diligeaoe that the silves he not consumed, bnt only thoroughly
refined by hest (ad purum excopsclrsr); those who are sent by the Ι
Conrt must give heed to this same point Now, when the test-
pieoe is made, the pesour tnhes it to the barone, accompanied by
the others, and weighs it before all their eyes against the pound
weight mentioned above: he proceeds to supply what the fire has
consumed hy adding pieces out oi the purae until the test-piene
hslsnoes the pound weight. Then the test-pleae is marked with
chath with these words, “Yorlrshire. The pound hurnt so marry or
romany pence,'' and then it is calledan ‘⁶ assay,” lor it is not marked
until it has been admitted that it should he so msrlred. But il the ’
uuir whose assay it is challenges iton tlte ground that an undae
quantity has been consumed [sc. hy overhcsting or hythe melting
ci the silverium the lead], or ii the melter sdmits that ior some
’ reason the test has sailed, twenty shillings are once more to be
connoed out hom the remsinder in the purse, so that the test may
be repeated as before? Again¹r ‘As longas s certain blsclr cloud
is seen hosting about on the surlace ol the molten silver the test is
considered incomplete. But when certain minute grains, as it were,
sre brought up from the bottom to tlte top and there dissolvcd‚ it is
tsign that the process is finished!
