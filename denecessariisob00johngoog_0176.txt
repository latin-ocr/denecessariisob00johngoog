Nonas

Pecs ⁵6, line r. ordinatis a deo. In this prefate the author
ie endeavouring to justify the double position of statesman and
ecclesiastic which had marked three generations of h'n family. His
political philosophy is that of a strong adherent of the king as
against the conception of a separate seeular and ecclesiastical
sate, and he makes use of almost the same lauguage and the same
citatione as Hugh of·Fleury in his treatise De regala potestate
(n troo). All power is from God; therefore in serving kings,
the ecclesiastic serves God; lsiugly power is dependent on dignityy
and on wealth; there may be bad binga, but the judgement of
their wickedness is for God; their subjecta must obey them,
and look after their wealth without regarding the use to which it
isput. 'I'be four cardinal virtues are necessary, but need money
to succeed. And therefore the author will write on financial
administrator, which is the most important part of govemment.
lilith the news thus stated contrast John of Salisbmys satirical
commenta (Polycroticus, c. xvii. 677 A, Migne) on the practice of
obtaining clerical preferment by civil employment. ‘Voluit esse
nobilis inter laicos aut certe magnus in clero. Ob hoc principum
morum quaesivit gratiam, familiaritatem iniit ab eis quascunque
suscepit mactiones. Scriniis forte praelatus est, aut consignandi
suroepit officium aut cimelii custodiam, aut publici claves aerarii,
ant ratiocinii varias cautiones, aut si quid aliud nequit, ut corbibus
praeficeretur, obtinuit! Cf. Rom. xiii. 1 ‘Omnis anima potestatibus
sublimioribus subdita ait: nou est enim potestas nisi a Deo: quae
autem sunt a Deo ordinatae sunt' John of Salisbury (Polycrotr'cus,
hligne, c. 455 A) quotes the text ‘omnis potestas a domino Deo
eat,’ as ‘illud Salomonis‚' referring to the Vulgate (Sap. vi. 4) ‘Data
est a domino potestas tobis!

The form of the prefate is of noune horrowed from Justinian's
lanatas (‘ Imperatoriam maiestatem non solum armis decoratam,
sedetiam legibus oportet, esse armatam,’ hc.) aa ia also that of
'Glanvill' '
