who received r4d. a day, and seeum to have been permanent only

duty, and certain chamberlaine who received as. a day and served
in rotation. There is also a ‘Tallator Regis‚' who receives his food
and gida day for hia man ς and a chamberlain without salary,
who receives hia food only. There is no clear line drawn between
the officere conoemed with Househoid duties and those who kept
the pn'vy purae, apd it is noteworthy that the Treasnrer and
chamberlain appear to rank aa colleaguet.

Before comparing this establishment with that of the Exchequer
of Henry 11 it is necessary to consider its members a little more
closely. It may be fairly assumed that the ‘Magister Camerariua'

ι was Aubrey de Ver, to whom the office was ςτιηῑεά in foe by
HenryI in succession to Robert Malet ¹. ln ¹130 we find him

Mauduit ⁸. The ‘Tallator Regis' mayhe the Godefridus Tallator ἵ
who resided in Winchester‘, or the Robertus Tallator who had a j
woodman at Eling‘‚ itt the New Forest. ' ’

It was from the staff of the Camera‘ that the principal members
of the Exehequcr ecurt were drawn, hut the fact that the Exchequer ¹
was both a place for the receipt and payment of money and a court ²
of account introduces additional complicatione. The officere of i
the Camers are not divided between these two functione, but each ,
officer hae hia seat in the Court and ia represented at the Receipt ·
by a deputy. The chief officer of the Camers—if it is proper to i
call him ao-who sits in the Enchequer is the Treasurert His

duties in the upper Exchequer are to receive the accounts of the
