Reoeipt and the npper Exchequer, passed into a ‘vacent interlunar
m: .

lt ie useless to endeavour to extract lrom the Dialogus, vhich is
a treetioe on the action ol the Exchequer while sitting, information
es to rhet took place when the Exchoquer vas not sittin33 and
for information es to the site ol the permanent repository ol the
neesme end rolls ol the Enchequer we must turn to other sources.
The question is briehy this: when the Exchequer eeased to sit,
what vas done with the money and documents that were in the
hands ol the officere?

At a latu date the question can be ansvered. They were placed
im the meamtties at westminster ¹3 hut in the reign ol Hehry 11
no such easy solution can he offered. Broadly speaking, win-
chester, the capital oi wessex, the original home ol the Norman
Tremury, remeined the place of permanent custody lor both money
end rolls⁸. But, so lar as the money is concerned there is un·
doubtedly evidence ol the existence ol other measuries in which it
might be placed, and it is quite possible that alter the Exchequer
had sat nt Oxlord, lor instance, both money and rolls might remain
there lor some time, pending their removal to winchester or to the
next place atwhichtheExchequer might sit. Temporarytreasuries⁸
might, therefore, exist in many plaoee3 and the lact that the Ea·
cheqner seems to hare sat more often at London than at any other
place, exeluding winchester, vonld prepare the vray lor the final
removal ol the permanent treasury lrom winchester to west·

minster .The dete ol that removal is uncertain It may be
conjecturally placed as happening about the end oi the reign oi
Henry 11, and as beooming oomplete during the reign ol
Richard I.
