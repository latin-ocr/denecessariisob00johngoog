necessary tc observe thot nc' tally that we have seen seems ιο be
cut exactly in the wey here described

We may now turn tc the actual nse cl the tany, especially as this
point isncwhere dealt with in the Dialogus. An accountant coming
ιο make his Eaater prolier would pay into the Exclrequer a certain
amount ol money; this amount would be recorded upon s tally in
the wey described above,and the tally would then be split down
the middle lor about three-quadem cl its length, end part cut oli ς
the soil, cr smaller part, was then given to the accountsnt, and the
atock, cr larger part¹, retained in the Exchequcr. Beyond this,
another usage arose at an early date. The tally becam regarded
as a species ci currency. Ii A had paid siro into the Exchequer,
receiving s tally lor that amount, he might hand his tally over to B,
in whose hands it vas equally good ior payment into the Excheqner.
Oi course, by this nanscction A lelt himself without delence against
the day oi final audit ol his account.

We ere now in e position ιο see that, with the aid ol the tally
and very simple' rclls, the whole business oi the Enchequer could
be carried on. The lay accountsnt ond the lay official would
understand the tally system ; the clerks oi the Treaaury would use
the written rclls. The whole bucineto would go on ‘ad taleas '‚'
without any need ol the more complicated arithmetic ol the abactas.
It is worth noting that the whole oi the work on the tallies ia under
the care cl laymen, while only the clerical official bundles the rolla.

As ιο the dote ol the introducticn cl the abacos, nothing can be
said’ beyond the lact that the Dablogur tells us that tallies were i'n
use before the absens. But it moy be suggested thou while the
former device is in use in many countriea, the latter is a specialiaed
device only employed by skilled calculatcra, oi which the history ia
fairly well known from the time ol Gerbert. While tallies may
have been in use in England belore the Conquest, the abacus is not
likely ιο have been known there; and in consequence we are en·
titled ιο date ita introduction aa occurring under the Norman
edministration. It ia worth noting that the word ‘Scaccarinm‚'
in the sense ol the Ccurt ol Acccunts, ia unknown cutside Nor·
mandy, Englsnd, and countriea directly subject tc their influence.

The examination cl the staff, the monetary system, ond the arith-
metic being now concluded, it only remeius to formidate the result, so
