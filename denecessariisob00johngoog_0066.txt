Treasury both by writ² and without ‘. Consequently, a Commis-
sion was appointed from timeto time to take account of all
receipts and hanes of the Treasury⁸. On this account it was

necessary to have tallies both for the sums received on account of .

blanching⁴ and for payments out made without writ An instance
of this is alluded to in the Pipe Roll of 31 Henry 1, when the Earl
of Glouoester and Briau Fila-Count took the accounts of the
Trensury of winchester¹⁵3 and at a later date the Bishop of
Carlisle obtained a charter from Henry ΙΙΙ that his executore
should not be irnpeded in carrying out his will by reason of any
such account due from nint But all this is external to the
ordinary Excheqner business, and therefore does not appear on
the Pipe Rode, which only exhibit the financial relations betwixt the
'Treanurer and the accountants 7; and for the same reason it is not
direetly treated of in the Dialogus.

Such, in brief, was the system by which the money owing to the
king throughout the country was collected and accounted for. For
further details of its administration we must refer the reader to the
printed Pipe Rolls and to Madox’s Ht'slory os tle Excleqtter.
