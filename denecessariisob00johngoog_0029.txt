The principal member ol the Chancery stall, who attended at tbe
Enchequer by virtue ol hia office,was the ‘clericus qui preest scrip-

this, he determined the form ol the writs iasued at the Erehequer,
and kept duplicates of them, though it does not clearly appear that
he eealed them⁸. When he acquired the power ol taking the
