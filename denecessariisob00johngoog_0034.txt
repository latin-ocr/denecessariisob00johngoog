INTRODUCTION 21

ilenry 11 restored to William Manduit, the younger brother oi
Rcbert Mauduit, not only the office oi Chamberlain, but also the
oste ci Porchcster, and all landa appendant to that office and
castle This grant, so iar as the castle oi Porchester goes, never
took effect, but there is abundant evidence that the office ol
Clumberlain returned to the Mauduit family in the person oi
William Mauduit, rabones succeeded by his son william, probably
inrr58 ¹. This erliam, the younger, is mentioned as sitting in
the Curia Regis¹ as Chamberlain at Michaelmas, 1165; and first
appears on the Pipe Rolls as chamberlain in ¹¹⁶7· The Testa
deNevr'll' shows another William as still possessed oi the office ol
chamberlain and the connected manor oi Hartley Mauduit.

The story ol the other chamberlainship is more obscure. It
lus already been said that in 1¹30 Geolirey de Clinton held the
other chamberlainship. We have not been ableto connect this
office with any definite estate during his tenure ol it, nor can
re truce any connexion between him and Warin Tite-Gerald, who
appears as Chamberlain with William Mauduit in 1¹5⁶· But from
that point the descent oi the ollice is clear, and is associated nith
the tenure oi the manor oi Sevenhampton in Wiltshire ⁴. Warin
held the office until 1161, and was then succeeded by his brother
Heury, who was succeeded by his son Warin Fitz-Henry in ¹¹74·
Both the Fila-Geralds are mentioned on the earlier Pipe Rolls as
receiving money ‘in camera curie' andree see that the chamberlain
cl the Honsehold was still closely connected with the Chamberlain
oi the Erchequer ⁵.

In the Enchequer oi Receipt almost the whole staff is made
op oi the deputies oi the Treasurer and chamberlaine The former
lt represented byn cleri, and the two latter hy knights, who
receive the usual ναμε· oi a knight, via bd. a day. The elerk
acures the treasure chest witha seal, and each knight hes a ltey;
to that rll three are jointly responsible sor the custody oi the
umore. The clerk keeps his account in young, and the knightsl
by tallias, just as in the upper Exchequer. These three officers
