This department is in some ways a rival to the Exchcqner and
independent 01 ic Payments made to the Camera escape all audit,
nor ere any accounts rendered hythe officere in charge os the

but even when the keeper 01 the Wardrobe was brought under the

Book 01 the Exchequer’ contdns mainngs ο1 the Evangelists which Ι
