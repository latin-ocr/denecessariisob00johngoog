No payment was made to the melter for repeating the test ¹, and l
the test-pieoes, when done with, were put by to be used ior making
silver plate, or for coinage ioruseabroad ¹. ,

Two serious difficulties ariae in connexion with this account, and ,
thrnw grave doubts on ita accuracy. In the first place, the only
mention oi the use oi lead is in the passage ignei salum ex utac-
h'om vel plumbi riifhw‘one ς and this passage, though supported by Ἴ
all the MSS.. hes the form oi a glosa Fmthermore, it is very
difficult to understand ¹. The uae ol an ash test, or cupel, instead
ο1 anordinary crucible, does indeed imply that lead was uaed ’ς but
it seems clear that Richard the Treasurer bad no idea oi the reason
ior its use, and consequeutly attached no importante to ita presence.
He was, however, conlessedly ignorant ο1 metallurgy⁸, anderen
shilled metallurgists oi a later date are inclined to regard the lead
as merely protecting the silver lrom volatilization⁰. Moreorcr, the
test ol the completion ο1 the process quoted above is consonant
with the view that cupellation was employed, since it may well rel'er
to the phenomenon known as ‘brighteningl We may probably,
therefore, msume that the difficulties ol the passage are solely dne
to the ignorance ο1 the author. In the second place, it will be
observed that the test-pieac, aa it leaves the melter's hands, is

assumed to be pure silver. Consequently, ii the account in the l

Dialogus were correct, blanch payments worrld have been made on
epure silver basis3 that is to say, the shen'ff would only have been
credited with the weight ol pure silver acmally paid in. There is
no mention ol any allowanoe being made ior alloy.

Now the account oi the origin of blanching given in the
Drhhgus' implica that the process was intended only to guard
against wear oi the coin, dipping, and salse coining⁸3 that is to say,
that the sherifl's payment was reduced from its current velue to its
vulne in standard siluer. We must conclude that the author of the
Dialogus regarded the standard silver as being pure 1111111 lt can. 1
