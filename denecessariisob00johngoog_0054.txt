INTRODUCTION 41

iauotlree from difficulty, it will be most convenient to give a tntt
translation ol the most important passage ¹.

‘Now dnoe we have mentioned nutu, consider brieliy how the
cutting osa tally is done. There are two kinds of tallies, one
called a tally simply, the other called a memoranda tally. The
length oi the tally, properly so called, is the distance between the
end ol the {otelinger and the thumb‚ when the mamb is etretched
ont; and at one end there is a small bole bored. The memoranda
tuly, which is always made l'or payments thet are to be blanched,
is sontewhat shorter, hemum after the assay by which the farm is
blandsed tlte original memoranda tally is destroyed, and then tirst
only acquires the length ot' ι tally when the tally oi combustion is
tied toit. The lnshion oi cutting is as follows: Athousand pounds
irmtstthe top oi the tally, by a cut thethiclrness oi the pslrn oi
the hnnd3 then a hundred pounds by a cut the breadtb oi the
thnmb3 a soore oi pounds, tlte breadth ot' the little linger ς asingle
pottnd, the width oi a lat barleycorn3 a shilling, rather narrower,
yet so that converging cuts remove some oi the wood and leave
there a little notclr3 a pennyis made bya single cut without re·
moring any wood On the edge where the thousand is cut no
other number must be put, saving only the hali oi a thousand, and
this by removing tbe hall part of that cut and putting it lower on
the tally. similarly you shall cut a hundred, il you have no thou·
ands, or a score oi pounds, or a single pound li'you have several
thousams or hnndreds or scores to cut, they are to be cut in tbe
same way ς on the more open edge’ oi ¹the same tally, thetis, on
the edge which is uppermost when the note is written on the tally,
tbehrgernumbermuetbecutandtbesmalleron theotheredge;
md on tbe more open edge the highest number is at the top, and
on the less open edge the smallest number. There is no cut to
dgniiya mark oi silver3 it is set out in chillings. The markos
gold is ent titre a pound, in the middle ol' the tally. A gold penny
is not cut exactly like e silver penny, but by cutting perpendicularly
into the tatty, not on the slope as is done in the silrer penny!
