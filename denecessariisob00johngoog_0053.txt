'l'he next use is the ‘cuditur's nse: ite. the use ol the Exchequer.
Here the connters ore plsced in columns, und Recorde points out
that the units ere spresd over es many lines ns the operator may
find convenient. lt moy be edded that they ttre placed in tvo rows,
end not more then three in s rovr. For the peuce, u single counter
sbove tbe units signifies od. ; in the shillings e single oounter
above the units on the right signifies 5, end n single counter on
the left ro; and the seme system applies to the pounds, scores ol
pounde, and so on. We moy nov set down ulier the ‘auditor's
use ’ the sum ol §198 ¹9³· nd. as before :-

lt vill be seen, on comperison, that this scheme almost exectly
coincidet with the scheme arrived at by Mt. Hubert Hall in the
peper referred to above. The evidence ol actual nse ol this devioe
is naturally difficult to discover. It must be songht in the cnsnnl
use ol it by accountnnts, marking the figures ol the counters by
dots on the margins ol accounts. One such instance iumentioned
by Mr. Hall. Another, ol s much earlier dote, vill be found in tb'e
Certulary ol Stnuley Abbey‚ printed¹ in the Wltrht're Magnete,
XV. p.r49, which probably dates from the thirteenth century. With·
out insisting that the ‘calculator' of the Dialogus employed the
‘nuditor's use' eracuy as described by Recorde, it may reasonably
be assumed thet his ‘acervi numerales’ were ol the sume nature.

We may novt return to the earliest arithmetionl device employed

at the Exchequer‚ the tally. As the description in the Drislogus

² 'l'nls is the snm used by Recorde himself.

ubere esch doed vill be found in the muniment soom. The device ernp oyed
differs lrotn ibe use dacribed above.
