eins residens esse debet cuius ligius est' Here oi course ‘ ligius’ is
applied to the tenant. Cf. also ibid. c. 55,§ a. And as to the
‚amin ibid. c 59, where ‘domini necessitas’ is mentioned as one
oi the reasons ior postponing a suit. ¹See Pollock and Maitland,
Ji Ε. L, i. 269.

P. 125, l ι. flunt ot. Neither Glanvill nor'the leger Hmra'es'
puisi attempt a complete list 'oi essoins. In all probability ex·
ceptional cases vvere considered on their merite. As the essoin
became a mere incident oi procedure, the essoin of sichness

,‘omnibus' below must mean all persons present and concemed in
the account, not'all the debtors.
