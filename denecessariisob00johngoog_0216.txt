est terra per viros discretos' suggests that the author ol the
Dialogus held the same view, though ha seems to stop at the
division into hundreda. Bnt the division and assessment date
from an unknown period ol history.

P. 109, i 7. comas autam est. Cf. lost. Cnuti (apud Heame,
Text. Rcyy. p. 45) ‘Comitis rectitudines secondum Angios istae sunt
communes cum rege: tertius damnus in villis vbi mercatum
mnnenms't et in castigatione latronum et comitales villas quae
pertinent sd comitatum eius et consuetudines liberalium hominum
duppliciter omnes habere‚' ac. Before the conquest this rule is
said to have held good only in the Dans-law (Liebermann Inst. Cn.
Tr. Rp. Insa Soc. 1893 pp. 86, 99). It will be noted that the
Just. Cnutt' (dated by Liebermann c. uro) speaks oi the third
penny oi maritet-towns and the third penny oi judicial profits as

both falling tc the earl. The Dialogus only mentions the third
penny oi the judiciai profita See on this point J. H. Round,
Geoffrq deMmrdeuille, p. 287. Aa to the comital manors mentioned
above see syron,1)0mesdaystuons.80merso. London 1880 ; and

i 13. porro vicecomes dicitur. The history of the name

‘moecomes’ belongs to Frankish history. There is no reason to
suppose that normaily in England the ‘vicecomes' was ever the
offioer oi the ‘comes’ (though special conditions might make
him so, aa in Oornwail, Chester, Durhatn, and other cases), and
‘Vroecomes' is simply the official translation oi ‘ Shen'ff!

h 16. Numquid ax singulis The emphasis is on the word
‘singulis'3 ‘are there,' says the scholar, ‘in every county earls
who receive these profitsl' ‘Nol answers the master, ‘only these
men (not aa Selden ‘these earls') receive them, whom the royal
boumy . . . creates cath, and to whom by reason oi that dignity it
decreea that these sums are to be granted, whether in see or sor
liia' The construction is, oi course, difficult3 ‘quibus' seems to
he pot ior ‘quos' &cause oi ‘conferenda' in the latter part3 but
the meaningis clear. Thera is not an earl in every county: but
when there is an carl, he gets the third penny ‘ratione dignitatis‚'
whether he is an earl in ise or only sor life. This is not the view
ol the passage taken by Selden (Tilles of Honour (1672) p. 523),
who has, however, been misied by a misquotation oi it by
Canacen, which he has cttriously treated as independent testimony.
