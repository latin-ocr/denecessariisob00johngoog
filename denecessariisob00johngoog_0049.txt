¹- 4. Mr. Ronnd has pointed out that the ‘firma comitatus' was
already in¹ existence in the time os Edward the Conieasor ¹. The
farm oi Warwickshire, ior instance, was ἑός under Edward. with
a boney rent commuted ior §24 8³. ς total, &89 8r. Under
Wiliiam 1 it was 5145, and there were other paymentat The
latter farm included ‘picas oi the county,' and thosis strictly
parallel with the iarms on the Pipe Roiis. .

5. The money need was eoined at various provincial minis,
most oi the counties coining their own money at the oonnty
towns.

The tint Pipe aot, the only roll remaining oi the reign oi
Henry 1, contains striking evidence oi the many changes that must
have taken piace between the time oi Domesday and the year ugo.
The system oi blanch payrnents is in iuli operation in addition to
pryments made numm and ad pensum& Comparison oi this roll
with Domesday suggests, in ieet, that what at the iirst date was an
exceptional thing had then become normad.

There is, moreover, some reason ior supposing that in ¹¹30
a transition was taking place at the Enchequer between the period
in which sama were paid ad pensum and the period in which they
were paid, at any rate iargely, in blancb money ⁴.

There are aiso traces oi a reorganiaation oi the imme oi countiea,
particularly in the case oi the large group oi counties in the hands
oi Aubrey de Vere and Richard Basset. There had certainly been
achange aiace Domesday. Oxiordshire, tbe Domesday iarm oi
which was 5249 5s. geist, with six ‘sextarii' oi honey (worth
about ἡ), now pays more than §332 rgr. rod. The tarn oi
Warwickshire, on the other band, appears to have iailen to about
§134 dr. ad.
