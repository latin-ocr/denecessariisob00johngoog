iumhaffects the question ol the origin of the complete Eschequer.
⁸ lntheoase of the staff, it hes been shown that the officers nithe
Trersury show most signs of s pre-Conquest origin. The monetsry
system, which is closely bound up with that staff, also leads back to
the sume ern. On the other hand, the arithmeticos the Exchequer,
like the main portion ol the staff oi the upper Exchequer, is clearly
ο1 foreign origin hs to the dates, or even the process by which
these different elemento were united, nothing precise can be said ;
but on general grounds it may be affirmed that the most likely
period ior the formation os the Erchequer in its linished shspels
ue reign oi Henry 1¹.

The Dialogus effords bnt little evidence as to the usual pisce oi
Ἴ sesion oi the Excheqner court during the reign of HenryIL The
scene ol the treatise is lsid upon the bsnks of the Thames, but
there is no evidence to show whether the window¹ where the
master and scholar tsihed was in westminster, in the Tower, or in
the Nev Temple, all places lor which claime might be pnt forward
We have⁸ in one place a sort ol geography ol the house oi the
Ειώοᾳιιει, where itis explained thatthere must be a private
thember sor council adjoining the actual house or room where the
Erchequer is held. But the passage does not suggest that any real
building is described, and in lact reads like an soeount oi the kind
ol plaoe that must be provided lor the court to sit in There is no
psmge in the whole treadse which assigns a definite place to any
ol the oourt’s offioers mentioned. Two places, indeed, are named
(lundon aad winchester ⁴) as places where the lower Erchequer
might be found And ii the passage relating to the rellerslis
pressed, it tends to show that the nsunl pisce of sitting was Win-
clrester, and that the presence os the Exchequer in London was less'
ireqneut3 and to this conclusion we should probably come upon
the evidence ol that passage. In the second part, however, we lind
in the writ ol summons‘ apssssge where the author might naturally
have mentioned some pisce ss the usuri one where the shcrili would
have to attend. But the words rii nel idi obviously show that he
regsrded it as quite possible that the Erchequer might sit in any
town· ιιι England And this· rs confirmed hythe passage which
