Bohun family, though it cannot be mnmed that at first it was held
by iuheritance.

The office ol marshal¹ during the reign ol Henry 11 was held by
John the Marshal, whose name frequently occurs on the Pipe Rolls,
and whose presence at the Exchequer is referred to by Fita-Stephen
ln 3 Henry 11 he is found making certain psyments to falconers‘‚
as described in the Dialogus.

The remaining ohioers ol the Exchequer cannot he assigned to
any department ol the lting’s Household, and may perhaps be re·

is particularly remarhed that the office ol ‘calculator⁸’ ‘nulli
illic residenti convenit ex officio uisi cui Rex vel Iustitia mandaverit

to the old stad ol the Exchequer, and iu neither case does the
Da'alogra give us anyhint asto the titles horne by their occupante
The first ol these two, Richard oi lichester, Bishop ol winchester,
is described as sitting ‘ex officio quidem sed ex novella constitu·

his work, especially in the writing ol the roll. The office seems not
to have continued ⁷, aud perhaps never received any special name.

The other office which was also created ‘ex novella constitu·
tione ⁸' seems also to have been atemporary one. The holder ol
it was Master Thomas Brown, the king's almoner'. His duties
were to watch and record all proceedings in the two Exchequers

behind the writer oi the Pipe Roll and keeping a roll, which was
the special property oi his master, and the other in the Reoeipt

Exchequer.
