renale Varum. Ci. 11. x. G.Jbelow, where theitenm γ

enumerated are-Chattels oi Felons and lugitives Tremure Trove,
Chattels ol usurers dying intestato and other casual proiits In-
stances are quoted by Madox, H. E. x. ς 8, pp. 237 sq.

l. ro. lionoris autem The processisas follows. Taking ¹

the great roll oi the ending year the treasurer's clerlr makes a roll
of all the dehts standing over in each connty. This is submitted
to the barone, and they fix for each dehtor the amount to be
demanded from him, considering special circumstances in the

various cases, and checlring each entry by reference to the great ³

roll The Chaucellor's scribe (cf. 1. v. V. above) takes the amounts

so fixed and draws up the summenses in the iorm given. As to
the hiring oi the amount to be collected, cf. ll. ii. B. below, ‘sicut ξ

presidentibus visum luerit?

, 1.2ι.ἱιτοῆιω alins οῑοτὶσυι. It appears irom1.v.V. .
above that this must have been the scribe oi the Chauoellor's Roll,

or ‘Scriptor Cancellarie.'

l. ²3· H. rex anglorum The sorrn of the summoue
continued much the same in later times. Under Edward H it
follows the form oithe Demque, substitutiug‘ coram Baronibus de l

scaccario' for ‘ad scaccarium: ‘omnia '‘ior nominatim,' and

omitting the clause‘ Et haec.. .de firmama’ Thislastalteration

is ducto the fact that the' iteum not derived from the previous Pipe 3

Roll were now demanded by a separate summotis called the
‘Summons' ol the Green War,' which appears to have taken

the place oi separate estreats sent direct to the Sheriff by the ἶ
Justices in Eyre. This course was no doubt due to the rapidity l
with which the Summons ol the Pipe increased rn length. (Cf. ÷

Two such rolls have been printed hythe Pipe Roll Society (vol ᾗ
ι4) as Rolls of the Kingds Corut, Nos. ll aud ΙΙΙ. In the former

of these, cases ol amercement and of murder-fine have been noted
on the margin, and the pleae ol the Crown in each hundred cou-
clude with an account ol payments, oi aid. As appears both
from the roll and from 11. x. below, the iunctione oi a Justice in
Eyre were as much ficem as judicial. He was as much concerned
