The evidence oi the Pipe Rolls ol Henry 11 does not bear
directly on the statement ol the Dialogus. In them ve lind tvo
systems ol' payment only, ad namnum and blanch. We find the
suma oi the enunties gradually reconstituted ¹, and there is abundant
evidence that many oi the connty mints continued working till
1180¹.

We have now to consider the evidence oi the chroniclers in ita
bearing on the question oi the origin oi the system oi blanch pay·
mnu. It will be found that two monetary reiorms are recorded
during the reign oi Henry 1, viz. i.n.1108⁸andi.n. 1125‘: the
latter ol these is confirmed hythe Plpe Roll oi 31 Henry1⁸.

Wemay nov return to the account moen by the Dr’alogru.
That account is obviously not complete, and our other materiuls
donot enable ns to fill up the gaps. On the one hand, livre re·
member that the account deals not with the general question oi
the payment ci money, but with the more limited question oi the
payment oi the larm ol the county, itis not necessarily incorrect.
On the other hand, lt certainly suggests several incorrect atate·
ments, though it is not clear that the author could have realized all
the meaning his langnage vould have borne to modern ears.

.We have attempted to construet a theory oi the history oi the
subject, which we offer as on the whole not inconsistent vrith the
schottus here summarlred3 hut it must be remembered that our
attempted reconstrnction rests upon alender foundations. At the
hottnm oi the iarm oi the connty lies the farm ol the royal demesne
mancr·; and the money iarm oi the demeane manor rests upon
abaris oi odginal rents in kind, estimated in terma oi supplies lor
a day. ln Domesday we lind these rents in iood expreseed in
terma ol money; and ve may gaesa that the meaning oi this vm
