In considering the arithmetic employed at the Exchequer, we
ere immediately contronted by tvvo conhivences, the tnlly and the
exchequer. We ere olso told tbnt therevrns s time when only tnlliee
vvere used, end when there vves no exchequer. The nature cl the
telly is pretty vell understood, but the vvord ‘excbequer’ has gutbered
round it so nuny connotations, thet it mey be useiul to consider
vbet the arithmeticel device known ss the exchequer vus. It ves,
says the Dialogus ¹, e four-sided boerd measuring ro ic by 5 fe, with
e raised edge round it It ves covered with s blech cloth rnled

In any cese the columns ere the important lecte, the uansveme
