NOTES 221

P. 133, l. 8. Porro eschaeta dicuntur. The Dialogus
divides escheats under the following heads:

r. Eseheats. Lands and goods ol tenants in chief dying with·
oot'heira.
' a. (a) Lauda and goods ol fugitives from justice.

(b) Goods of those who sailed iu the ordeal under the Assize

ol Clarendorr.

3. Treasure Trove.

4. Goods ol Usurers.

Glanrill (VII. c. 17) dealing ol escheata in general gives-

1. hands and goods of persons dying without heirs.

a. ot female warda guilty of unchastity.

3. Ol felona and outlaws. ’ The land going to the lord, the
goods and ‘a year, day and waste ol the lands to the king!

'ibe goods ol usurers are treated of in the previous chapter.

Glaovill’s clasaification is more in accordance with actual prac-
tice than that of the Dialogus. Escheats are landa falling to the
king by reason of lailure ol heirs or by the fault ol the tenant. ot
course the author ol the Dialogus writes from the point ol view ol
finance and this accounts sor his etassiticatton though the omission
oi all reference to ‘marriage' is curious. The expression ‘escaeta
Eum herede' appears to he peculiar to the Dr'ologua3 custodiit
is the usual term.

l aa. octena voro . . . munt A case ol ordinary law as
to wardahips ; cs. Glauvill, vii. 9.5 3. Glanvill adds that is a ward·
ship is granted by the king with the addition that it the grantee is
not to account at the Exchequer‚ the grantae may present to
chorches and otherwise treat the estate as his own, in other cases
not (lbid. ro. 5 3). Such granta under various conditione will be
found in Madox (H. E. x. 5 4, pp. aar sqq.).

l. 25. legittime atatis adeptus beneficia, i. e. in the case
ol a military tenant on the completion of the twenty-first year, in
that os a soheman on the completion ol the fifteenth‚ and in the
case ot' a burgess when the boy can count money, measure cloth
and so forth, Glanvill, vii. 9. 5 a.

iridua de Bohun debet cc. libras pro releuio terre sue! So'
also P. R. aa Hen. H. Rot. 5 b ‘Ricardus Malebisse reddit com-
potum de roos. pro releuio suo. ln thesauro liberauit. Et Quietus
