omines tbe aberiff as to the ‘Corpus Cominus: just as the

Chaucellor's clerk examines him as to the estreats¹. He is per·
somlly responsible both sor all thetis done in the upper Exchequer
and sor the receipts and payrnents in the Exchequer oi Receipt,
rbere he has his deputy. But this responsibiiity is shared in both
brancbes os the Enchequer by the two Chamberhins, who are the
Treasnrer's close colleagues ¹. Their personal duties in the upper
Ereboquer do not seem to extend beyond sharing the Treasurer's
responnbility. They also have their deputies ia' the Receipt.

may be mentioned simply as Treasurer, aud uo added nord shows
ubetber he is Treaaurer oi England or oi Normandy. Next the
nord ‘chamberlain' is very loosely used, being sometimes applied
to persons who have clearly no connexion with the Excbequer.
