ιο INTRODUCTION

Treasurer.1n 1130, however, the office ol Chsncellor was held
by Geoffrey‚ afterwards Bishopof Dnrhsm3 and itis probable that
Geolirey de Clinton was Τιιιιιιιιιιιιι as well ιι Chamberlain.

'Ibe Pipe Roll oi 31 Henry 1¹ mentions him as paying lor the
‘ministerium thesauri Wintonie'; and he had nlso⁸ been engaged
in financial business ιιι Normandy' ιιι conjunction with Robert
Mauduit, the other Chamberlain It might, however, be held that
Roget, Bishop oi Salisbury, remained Treasurer until the date ol the
collapse oi the administration under Stephon. It ιι probable‚ bnt
by no means certain, that the first Treasurer ol Henry 11 was Nigel,
Bishop ol Ely; but horn 1168* the Tressurer was Nigel's son
Richard, the author oi the Dialogus Tbeoffice ol Treasurerwasnot
a sery’eanty, and was not connected with the possession ol any land;
but the two chamberlaine were both laymen, and held their
offices ιι scrjeanties. The story oi one ol these offices can be
traced with some approach to completenessh

In Domesday we find ι certain William Mauduit' ιιι possession
oi Porchester andos the monor ol Hartley Mauduit ιιι Hamp-
shire. His son, Robert Manduit, who presumably inberited these
mauors, was one of the Οιιιιιιειιιιιιιτ under HenryI. He died
about 1129-3o,lesvinga daughter and hebens, who was purchased
by William de Pont de l’'Arche ,together with her inhesited office,
lor1,ooo marks. At the same time Williarn also acquired ior
himself the‘ ministerium camere curie, 'which was probably the
office mentioned ιιι the‘ Constitutio' as held by Williann Mauduit
the younger, brother ol Robert. In this way ιι might have been
supposed that the whole office would have passed' into the family
ol William de Pont de l'‚Arche who certainly exercised the office
in 1129-30', and continued to hold it until atter the accession
ol Stepben²⁰. But shortly belore his accession we find¹¹ that
