24 lNTRODUCTION

The nsher has a deputy in the Common Bench¹ and not in the
King's Bench. The marshal, on the other hand, had his deputies
both in the Exchequer and in the tttngu Bench'3 but the marshal
of the Common Bencb was a deputy cf the marshal of the
Erebequer. A few words mua suffice for the devolution cf the
office of uaher. From 1156 to 1167 it was held by Roger of
wallingford His successor was Elias, who seems to have held

⁴ retained the office undl 1191, when Laurence, presumably the son

of Roger, became usher; and the office continued in the family
of de scaccario, as it grew to be called, nntil 1304, whenvit was
divided between cobeiresses ⁴.

The office of nsher cf the Receipt seems to have becotoe
separated at some nme from tbat of usher of the Ercheqner, since
in 18 EdwardI Adam de Stratton⁸ held a mciety of it, which he
presumably acquired by purchase.

The remaining department of the lting's Housebold is that of
the constables. Their number isnot specified, nor whether, asis
probabis, they served in turn. if so we may regsrd the constable
on duty with 5s. a day sslary as tlte head of the department, having
under him John, the chief marshal, with a sslary of as. a day.
The chief marshal thus holds a position like that of William
Maudnit in the Chamber, or the Keeper of the Seal in the Citanoery.
The constables' department includes the whole outdoor staff of
the Household, especially those who have to do with horses cr
hunting. The marshal has the special duty of witnessing all
expenditure by the king's officials, and keeps account by means
of tallias (dt'cas) both of payments out cf the Treasnry and Chambes
and of other expendituret This right of general snpervision may
be the ‘Magisterinm in Curia Regis de liberatione Prebende’
for which John the Marahal owed fcrty marks of silver in
κ 31Henry1'.

In the Excheqner the staff cf this department consiste of the
constable ⁸, his clerh'‚ and the marshal ¹⁰. Their fonctions in the
Eschequer resemble their functione in tbe Honsehold These three
form an independent court for the purpose of payirtg all soldiers
