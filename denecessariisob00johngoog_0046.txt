mund they are ιο pay! On the other hand it contains a passage¹
vhich makes two misleading assertione: (a) that hlanch farm is not
mentioned in Domesdsy, (b) that blanch farm was invented by
Roger of Salisbnry. This latter passage may we think be safely
rejected as a gloss on literary grounds done. Its contradiction ol
the rest of the Dialogus may be held ιο confirm that view.

ln another passage ¹, while the assertion that money paid in
hythe sherifi' is blanched by assay remains, we find that the farm

taken with the passage referred to above, seems to imply that ¹(a)

be noticed that Northnmberland cumberland, Weatmoreland‚ and
Durham do not appear in the Domesday return. ln Shropshire
and Cheshire the king held no landa. In Sussex he had Bosham,
which is always accounted ior separately‚ and Rotherfield, which
was land of the Bishop of Bayeux. The land he held between
