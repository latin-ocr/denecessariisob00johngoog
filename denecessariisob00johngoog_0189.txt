uruat satisfy hall oi each debt at Easter before the amount paid
sit thesauro on account oi farm can be actually credited to him.
His ‘memoranda' tally may therefore require alteration. The
nrm shown on the memoranda tally in ita tinal form must then be
‘blanched,' and the taliy cutter then returns to the sheriff a tally oi
full length (longsbm), which the sheriff produces again at Michael-
rnaa See Introduction, pp. 41, 48 and 50.

P. 73, l. 3¹· non minen . . . debito. The constnrction oi this
clause is very looae. ‘vicecomites' understood seems to be the
subjectos ‘niteant’3 ‘quod iam solutum fuerit' of ‘redigatur' ⁹
aad ‘vicecomes' understood oi ‘abmtmnn’3 but ‘oblata talea'
may be taken aa a nominative. The sense is the same

P. 74, l 5. Immoqnia. See Introduction, p. 41.

i ro. :temeranda raro . . . mamm. Here again the con·
stnrction is confused. The sense seems to be as follows. When
the eherili pays in money on account ol his farm he is given
a Memoranda tally which is shorter than an ordinary taliy.
When the money is blanched the Memoranda tallyis destroyed,
and the payment is then first'expressed by a lawsul taliy os the
ordinary length with a separate tally attached to it showing bow ’
much has been deducted on account ol blanching. Compare
however ‘Introduction to the Study oi the Pipe Rolls’ [P. R. Soc.
vol. iii], p. 69, where another interpretation has been adopted.

l. 1⁴· In summos i.e. at the broad end oi the tally which
is supposed to be nearest the cutter. · ,

i. 26. ax patentiore parts, ‘on the obverse of the tally.'
The taiiyis bevelled off at the narrow end, ar'rd therefore the
obverse, consisting os one side and the bevelled end, is longer than
tbe reverse, which consiste only of the other aide.

l. ay. qne. . . annotatione, ‘the edge which is uppemost
when the tally is inscribed! The tally cutter is holding the taliy
with the square end towards him, the bevelled end from him and
sloping downwards and outwards. The plain edge os the tally is
underneath and the writiug on the side ol the taliy is¹ the right
way up.

l. 30. hoo est denuit, ‘that' is to say, the peuce! These t
words appear to be an early marginal note which has crept into
the text. They occur, however, in all manuscripts.

be distinguished irom tbe ponnd oi silver by the position ol the cut Χ
