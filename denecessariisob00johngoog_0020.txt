Eaton Harl MS. ι

These are all modern manscripta

We are indebted to Mr. Hubert Hali for giving us a list of tluese
manuscripts, to which we have only been able to add two, and for
the description of those which we have not ouraelves examined

There isone MS. translation-

Bn‘trii Murmur, MS. Lansdowne 610, enhtled ‘ammio-
nom? This is a translation of the Dablogas by ‘W. Β. gent!
ΑΟ ι647, and has been made from N or some derivative of N.

With these materiale we have adopted the following method of
constructing our text In orthography we have been guided by
the Pipc Rolls of Henry IL These recorda were written under
theeyeoftheTreasurer undu bislanguage¹,andmayfnirlybe
taken as representing his standard. As a result we have expelled
jfrom the alphabet, and made use of n at the beginning and u in
the middle of words to represent either a or n. ln such words
as ‘exitium’ wehavepreferredtto c,andwa havcmedthe single
sinmead of the diphthong ae. We have attached no importante
to 'the spelling of any of the MSS. Wbcre tbe reading is doubtful
we have considered the evidence of N aud R combined as slightly
superior to that of C alone; but in the absence of agreement
between N and R we have almost invariably followed C, and have
considered the agreement ofC with either N or R conclusive

We bave been unable to regard certain passages as forming
part of the original argument of the neatioe3 our exclusion is
based for the most parton historical or logical incompatibility
between the parts excludod and the rest of the treatise. Once
a passage in itself suspiciousis variously placed in two of our three
MSS.; but as a rnle the MSS. agree in the insertion of the pas-
sages we regard as interpolatione. We are not, however, bound
to mame that the archetype of X and C was a copy from the
original MS. with its marginal notes inserted at the points at
which they occurred. We may msume the original MS. to bava
been completed before April, 1179; the date of R is approximately
rago-1246. We have at most to place two intermediate MSS.
within fifty-two years, aud allow time for the second to become
