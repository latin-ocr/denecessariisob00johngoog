INTRODUCTION 27

which it is mentioned suggests that it was an menate copy ol
the Pipe and Chaucellor’s Rolls In the second passage it is
descnb& in grandiloquent terms as containing ‘iura regni regisque
secreta' The two descriptione seem incompatible, and we do not
sse bow to reconcile them.

u has been renarked above that the appointment ol Thomas

Brown was a purely personal one ; no successor to him is known,
and no trace remains ol bis tollor of that kept by his clerlr in the Ι
lowerExchequer. But tbere is reason to think that inform and
sunction be is represented in the final lorrn ol the Exchequer.
The King's Remembrauoer seems, in later times, to bave done very
much what he did ; and though there is no clear continuity between
theoninos, the great lilreness between thern is worth noting. In
the saun way the bructions oi the clerlr in ὼε lower Erohequer
are at a later date performed by the Auditor oi the Receipt. Here
again there is no stated continuity oi office, only a similarity in
hnction.

The statements ol tbe Drrugw as to the payment ol the Ex-

cannot therefore be regarded as a permanent department⁸, but
merely as a hranch ol the Court oi Excbequer. Further, with the
exception oi ὼε Chaucellor’s scribe, all those who bave payments

Erehequer was not sitting ⁴, and in such cases were specially paid
by orders on accountants The other members ol tbe court pre·

by the ‘ Camers Curiess or else uere pald by the persons on whose
behall they acted. We know at least that under Henry 1 tbe Chan-
oellor had his 55. a day' while sitting at the Exoheqner, but it does
. not appear bow that salary was norr'nally paid. With regard to
those persons who must haue had duties at the Treasury when ὼε
Baebequer was closed, such ss the deputy-chamberlains, ὼε usher,
sud probably the watohman, it may be suggested that those who
