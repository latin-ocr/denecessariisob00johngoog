penalties ior breaking the law, or sooalled voluntary payments
made to the king with the object either oi obtaining some con··
cession, or ol escaping some punishment. The former may be
called amercements, the latter hnes. Reliefs, or the sums paid by
beirs to be allowed to bave possession oi their lands, cannot
conveniently be classed under either oi these heads ¹. On all lines
apayment ol 9 per cent. is ma& to the queen, whose clerk attends
in the Enchequer to receive tt‘. These ameroernenta, fines, and

- reliefa are collected upon the repon ol the Justicea in Egra, and the

account is subdivided into sections according to the eyres in which
the debts were maessed ⁸. The debts assessed hythe oeutral court
sitting at the Exchequer have a aection to themselves ⁴, and the
most recent amercements and lines come under the heading
‘Nova Placita’

The next stage os the sherid's account is the account oi the
goods os ielous and fugares and usurers, trecente-trove, tec. This
is the last item on the roll ⁸. The sheriff is bound to collect and
account ior such goodn without being summoned to do so ⁸. The
reason given sor the separation of these casual profits from the
escheats is not convincing': it may be conjectured that they come
last because they cannot be sormally demanded, but depend on the
evidence of the eheriff. Probably this stage oi the account was
dealt with by the Treasruer, but oi this we carmot be certain.

The account oi the sherili‘s farm can now be completed⁸. For
this purpose all the members of the court are called together: the
sum pald in by the aberiff (or what is lest of it after the satisfaction
ol the other accounts) is eet out in munters on the table. The
aum to be deducted for blanching is calculated at the rate deter-
mined by the assay. The tally for the payment made at Easter'
is produced, with its combustion tally attached. The sum os tbe
two blanch payments is added up and recorded on one tally, to
which another smaller tally is attached showing the amount de·
ducted sor blanching. The sheriff is only credited with the amount
expressed in the larger tally, but tbe Treasurer is accountable ior
the sum oi the two. The total with which the sheriff is creditcd
remeius set out in a pattern of counters on the Enchequer table.
The Treasurer now produces the Roll of Farms (Raetus Exac-
