Chanoelor's place in sealing all Exchequer write, he probably-
beosrne in lact independent of the Chsncellor‚ aud received the
t'tle ol Chaucellor of the Exchequer. The date ol this changeis
not known, but cau be approximately arrived at lrom the following
consideratione. Itis certainly later thau ¹4 Henry ΙΙΙ, on the
Closs Roll¹ os which year is a writ dated Nov. Β, in these words:
‘Rex mittit baronibus de Scaccario Robertum de Sancto Medardo‚
clericum, sd scribendum ad scaccarium regis, loco Nicholai de
Nevill, nomine R. Cicestrensis episcopi! lt is clear from this thet
erph de Nevill, Bishop oi chichester, the Chancellor, was at this
date Cbancellor also in the Exchequer. On the other hund, in
³² Henry 111 ¹, Ralph ol Leicester resigned the office oi Chaucellor
oi the Exchequer. Fortbcomiug publicatione will probably settle

the uuuer past a doubt. In the meantime it may be suggested .

that ss Henry 111, when the king took tbe seal into his owu
heeping, is s likely date for the change to have taken place.

'lbe Chsncellor's scribe was the immediate subordinate os the
‘clericus qui preest scriptorIo'.' His duties were to copy the
Pipe Roll, while it was being written by the Treasurer's scribe,
and to write all the writs issued out ol the Exchequer by tbe
Barous, including the summouees ior the ensuing term. His pay
was 5d. a d'ay‘ during the session of the Exchequer, apparently
the customary weges ol a scribe ⁶. It may be noted that heis
the only member of the Chancellor's staff whose pay is given
in the megia. In process ol time be became the officer lmown
as the ‘Comptroller oi the Pipe’

Passing over the departments of the Steward and Butler, which
are not represented at the Exchequer‚ we oome to the Chamber·
lain’s department. In the ‘Constitutio' there are two officers
mentioned under this head, esch receiving 5r. a day. These are
the ‘Magister Camerarius' and the Treasurer. The chamberlain is
s consent member oi the Household while the Treasurer only
receives his allowance ‘si in Curia luerit et servierit in thesauro!
This seems to point to tbe separation between the Treasury aud
tbe‘Camera Curie'whicb we find st the wool theDr'alogus‘. Ol ,
