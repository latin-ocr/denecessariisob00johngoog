the diiierence was paid in money. This system lested until the

reign ol Henry 1, when tvvo causes brought about an alteration. ’

next place the burden oi transporting the produce demanded l

produced sericus complaints. Accordingly a commission was

appointed to examine into the whole question; the lood payments t

vvere replaced by money psyments; the farm charged upon the
sheriff vas revalued; end it vves ordered that he should be
responsible ior the payment ol the vhcle, and pay at the Ex-
'chequer ² adseclam. This lost termis enphined to imply an extra
payment oi idon each pound to cover any loss that might ariae
, from the wear ci the coin. In process oi time the vear oi the·
coinage compelled the introduction ol payments ad usuum, or by

actual weight ol silver¹. Finully Roget oi Salishury, when Treasurer‚ u

made the mle that owing tc the debssed state oi the coinage all
silves paid in vves tobe tested, and the sarm psid in silver of proper

fineness. This was called payment blaneh‚ and vves usust under
Henry 11.

Now it must be observed that the scccunt is completely
traditiooal except in one point, via where the author appeals tc
the fact that entries ci payments ad scalam and ad perseam occur
on the Pipe Rolls of Henry L Nevertheless the tradition is good

ci its kind Nigel‚ Bishop of Ely, nephewos Roger oi Sallsbury ’

and father ci our author, vras employed in the king's service in χ
1130 as Treasurer oi Normandy⁸‚ and his evidence would be good l

as to the practice under Henry 1. Richsrd Fre-Nigel further cites ζ
men whom he has seen himself, who had themselves seen the y
provisions broughtto the king's court. The period to be bridged l

is short—rm. rrcc to run. utic—only eighty yesrs. We must >
therefore be car'esul ¹not to reject the story ci the Dialogus without Ἴ

’ due consideration.

We may now turn to the other passages in the Drizlogvs in
which these methods oi payment are mentioned The most l

striking cl these (Ι. iv) is remarkable ior two reasons. On the one ο

hand it recognises that blanch farm goes back to Ssxon times,
