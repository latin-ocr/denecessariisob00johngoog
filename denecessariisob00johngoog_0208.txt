ώωᾱοη of the settlement made after the Conquert It is not
horim in form, but rather a legal theory of the history of the
clanges then made. According to this view all the English land·
ltolders who had actually resisted William, lost their lande at once
and for ever, a statement which facts recorded in Domesday show
tobe very probable ; those who had not taken part in that resis-
lauce (the great majority) remained iu possession of their lauds,
but found themselves mere holders at will under foreign lords with
uo inberitable interest. Evictions of these precarious tenants pro-
duoed a royal decree giving them a new title enforceable against
their lords arrd recogniaing two classes of tenure, viz. tenure by the
favour of the lord, mmh's exigentem, and tenure under a contract,
mensem maius. Now it is clear that this passage is not
applimble to tenants in chief, and that it does not referto the
process by which men ‘bought' their landa from William (Α. S.
Chrom'cle, a⁰ 1066): but that it describes the establishment of legal
relations between the lord and under-tenant by royal authority.
hclose parallel will, however, be found in the famous passage in
Baeton f. yb, where he discusses, not the condition of English
laudowners after the conquest, but that of certain tenants within
mauors of royal demesne. Bracton tells much the mme story3
these tenants, free at the conquest, were ejectedhy their new
fords, restored in aworse condition, and provided by the crown
nith a legal remedy. 'Ihese tenauts also were of two kinds, those
’ΒΟ held with a special agreement, and those who had none.
Brauon’s account, again, is s legal theory of history rather thau
history, The problem suggested by this parallel isdouble ; firstly,
arethe two authors thinking of the same set of facts? and secondly,
vas Bracton acquaiuted with this passage? The second question
isone for commentatore on Bracton3 but in answer to the first it
may be pointed out that it is almost incredible that a theory which
bacun applies to an exceptional class of small holders on the
royal demesne cun, be equally applicable when extended to every
bnholder in the country. It may be suggested that the Dialogus
has set ont to tell one story and ended by telling another. Another
tud apocryphal version of the story will be found in the passage
quoted hy Wilhins (Leges Anglo-Saxom'cae, p. 286) from a manu·
ttript pedigree of the Sharneborue family, subsequently printed by
Glbson in his Relr'qruhe Spelmanmbnce. Here it is asserted that
lle Conqueror ordered such tenants to be called ⁴ Drengs? [a Danish
