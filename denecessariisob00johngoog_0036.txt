metten bnt it appears that William the Meher, who died about
thiebard 1, had lands¹. There is a Richard Fundor named in
the Pipe Roll of 3 Hemy 11 ¹, and a Gilbert Fusor occurs in
ro Henry 11¹, bnt he may have been' employed in the recoinage ‚
of 1180, and not in the Exchequer. In 24 Henry 111, Otes, son
of John the Melter, sold the serjeanty to Edward, son of Otes the
Goldsmith‚ apparently a member of the well-known family of
Fata-Otho, which held the office of cutter of the dies And in
13 Edward 1 the king purchased the office from Otes of West·
minster, possibly the representative of that Edward‘.

The nsher of the Excheqrrer and the usher of the Receipt may
nort conveniently be discussed as one officer. The Dialogus is
not indeed explicit upon this point; but there is reason to think⁵
that the nsber of the Receipt serves in the name of the usher of the
Erchequer. The passage· in which the treatise states him to be

ne servam or the Transfer and cmmsernms s not monsieur ' ·

trith this view. But it can be shown from other sources that the
ushers of the Receipt and of the Exchequer viere only another
instance of a duplicated office. Roger of wallingford, who is
mentioned as ‘ostiarius Thesauri'' in a Henry ΙΙ, received the
‘Magistratus Hostierie de Scaccario’ by a charter⁸‚ which is dated by
hlr. Eyton as about Michaelmas in that year. Assuming‚ therefore,
tha we are only dealing with one office in two different places,
it may be pointed 'out that we bave here an old office belonging
to the original mall of the Treaspry and Chamber. Like the
offioes of the chamberlains, the neigher, and the mehor, it was
a serieanty3 and was connected with the manor of Aston Rowant'
(Eamne) in Oxfordshire‚ witichis mentioned in Domesday among
the ‘Terre Ricardi et aliorum ministrorum regis' Both in the
‘Constitutio ¹⁰’ and in the Drhloges¹¹ there is an apparent connexion
between the offices of the ushsr and the marshal. ¹ But closer
inspectior makes it probable that tbe usher is primarily an officer
of the Treasury‚ and not, like the marshal, arr officer of the Curia.
