contained in the uesfise, with full discussions of many incidental
points, in which will be found some conjectursl attempta to improue
portione of the text. Most, if not all of these, have been included
in later editions of the senet Charterr.

The Select charan text, the one most accessrble, is still substan-
tially the text formed by Madox sud Holmes. But this text is in
places uncritical and the collation unuumworthy. For an instance
of both these faults we may refer to 11. ii. E, F, where Madox
reads ‘diceres hunc illo longe mitiorem extitisse,' with the note
⁴ 1. N exisse’ The reading in both N aud R is, however, ‘mitius
exisse,' and the correct reading is without a doubt ‘mitius egisse?
Here the mistake does not effect the sense, but in the prefaoe to
Part 1, B the conversios cf the ‘mammona’ of the MSS. into
‘in misericordis’ bas made nonsense of the passage.

The first object which we proposed to ourselves was the con·
struction of a better text than the existlug one. An examination
of the MSS.1 showed that only four of the many in existence were
likely to be of use for this purpose. Of these four the MS.
known as Hargrave ³13 was found to be only an incorrect man-
script of that in the Red Book, without any traoe of an independent
source. The three remaining were the Red Book of the Exchequer,
here called R; the Black Book of the Exohequer, here called N3
aud the Cotton MS. Cleopatra A 16, bere called C. It speedily
becam clear that none of these three was the original, and that
ln all probability none was even copied from it It was also clear
that R and N were copied from a common original, which was
uot the original of C. Comparlson of R aud N showed further
¹ that their common original omitted certain passages which existed

in the original of C; moreover, the signs of uncertainty shown l

in the MSS. as to the proper order of the words in many pas-
sages suggested that interlineatious or marginal notes had

been differently interpreted by the two unknown originale. Con- t
siderations of this kind led us to the conclusion that the history t

of the MSS. before us wss probably the following. From the l
original text of Richard Bitu-Neai two copies, which we will call l
X and Y, arose. X, while in a good condition, was copied into y
the Red Book of the Bxchequer in the first half of the thirteenth
century, and at a later date, at the end oi the same century, when t
