P. 156, l. 4. accipitres scilieet vel mounes. ‘Accipiter' is
probably used bere ase classical equivalent ior ‘ialco,' although¹
tbe latter word occurs in Servius and Isidore 3 otherwise ‘accipiter'
must be taken to mean a tiercel. Ol the varieties mentioned ‘Nor-
rensis' is presumably the Norwegiau gerfalcon, ‘Hibernensis’ may
be the peregrine, and ‘Hispauensis' the Barbary falcon or perhaps
the Saker. Tbere seems to be no mention ol the Goshawlr, whicb
is usually rendered by ‘Asturcus’ The Hon. Gerald Lascelles
(Falconry‚ Badmr'nton lebam) gives the moulting period os April
or May to August lor Eyesses‚ and July or August to February sor
Passege Falcous: which would seem to show tbat tbe birds were
taken from their nests end not caught when full grown. ‘Hornus'
for ahevvk in its first plumege is clearly an expedient toavoid
using the mediaeval Latin ‘sorus ’=‘ soer' or ‘red'
