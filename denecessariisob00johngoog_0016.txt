We may now prooeed to describe the MSS. wc have used.

R = The Red Book ol the Erchequer (King's Rememhranccr,
Miscellansot'as Boon, No. a), ff. 31-46.

A MS. on parchment, καῖ’ x Ψ, in double columns, rubricated,
with the initials illuminated alternately in red and blue. The ‘Red
Book’ has always been preserved in the Erchequer as a book
οἱ authority, and contains various collectione relating to matters
concerning the Exehequer administration. Α fuller account ol it
vill be found in Mr. Hubert Hall’s edition in the Rolls Series,
pp. i-cxlviii. The handwriting is dated by Mr. Hali in the second
qnarter ci the thirteenth century ⁸.

H :Brilr'rh Momm, MS. Hargrsve 313, ff. a-5 and 16-29.

It has a considerable likeness to R, ol which it is apparently
a contemporary copy. We collated this MS. aa iar as L v. H,
but as it shorred nc trace ol representing any independent authority
wc have not recorded its varicus readings ⁴.
